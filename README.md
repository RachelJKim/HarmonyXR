# HarmonyXR

HarmonyXR is a collaborative music composition tool developed in Unity for Meta Quest devices, designed to make music creation accessible to both deaf and hearing users. 
This project was created for the hackathon hosted by StanfordXR, [Immerse the Bay 2024](https://immersethebay.stanfordxr.org/). HarmonyXR vIisualizes music as abstract elements, allowing users to interact with and modify music through gestures in an immersive mixed reality environment.
